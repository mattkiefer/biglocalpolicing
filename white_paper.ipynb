We know that there seems to be a discrepancy in the search rates of Native American drivers compared to White drivers, but are Native American drivers searched more frequently closer to the reservation? To find out, we analyze the Native American search rate in and around Flathead Reservation and compare it to the relevant search rate in Montana as a whole."

Notably, the search rates in and around Flathead Reservations jumped to 3.02% for Native Americans. this is a threefold increase. Meanwhile for White drivers, the increase was minimal, only jumping to 0.26%. These numbers can be found above in sections 2 (statewide) and 4 (Flathead)."
